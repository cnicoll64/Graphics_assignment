How to run:

  First copy and paste all files from the Assets folder into the main project directory where the source files will be compiled.
  To run with visual studios, include the graphics assignment folder as an included directory under vc++ compiler under project settings.
  
  Next, copy and paste all the .dll files from the bin folder from the sfml folder to the main project directory, make sure to specify
  additional libraries in visual studio project settings so that sfml works.
  
  If all is well a main menu with blokus graphics should display with options for different game types.
